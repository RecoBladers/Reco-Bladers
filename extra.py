Reco Bladers - Extra Python Script

This script is a placeholder to demonstrate Python code in the repository.

import random import time import datetime

Function to print current time

def print_current_time(): current_time = datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S") print(f"Current Time: {current_time}")

Random quote generator

QUOTES = [ "Innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower.", "The best way to predict the future is to create it.", "Code is like humor. When you have to explain it, itâ€™s bad.", "Simplicity is the soul of efficiency.", "First, solve the problem. Then, write the code." ]

def random_quote(): quote = random.choice(QUOTES) print(f"Quote of the Moment: '{quote}'")

Fibonacci Sequence Generator

def fibonacci_sequence(n): print(f"Generating Fibonacci sequence up to {n} terms:") sequence = [0, 1] while len(sequence) < n: sequence.append(sequence[-1] + sequence[-2]) for num in sequence: print(num, end=" ") print()

Countdown Timer

def countdown_timer(seconds): print(f"Starting countdown of {seconds} seconds:") while seconds > 0: print(f"{seconds} seconds remaining...") time.sleep(1) seconds -= 1 print("Time's up!")

Main execution

if name == "main": print_current_time() random_quote() fibonacci_sequence(10) countdown_timer(5)

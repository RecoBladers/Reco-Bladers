      <h2>About Reco Bladers</h2>
      <p>
        Reco Bladers is a dynamic creative group founded on <strong>26th November 2025</strong> by two visionaries: <em>Rudra Pratap Sharma</em> (Founder) and <em>Swastik Prem Srivastava</em> (Co-founder). Our group has grown from a small, enthusiastic team into a renowned creative hub, focusing on developing original stories, unique apps, and innovative digital projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        Under the visionary leadership of our CEO <strong>Swastik Prem Srivastava</strong>, who took permanent charge on <strong>8th March 2025</strong>, Reco Bladers has transformed dramatically. The group’s governance shifted from a democratic system to a monarchical system through a secret plan known as <em>MM</em>, which has streamlined decision-making and accelerated growth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since January 2025, Reco Bladers has flourished with many achievements, including launching its own Gmail system, official website, and development of a proprietary language. The team is continuously working on exciting projects that will redefine digital creativity.

      <h2>Brief History</h2>
      <p>
        Reco Bladers was born from the shared passion of its founders to create a unique space where storytelling, technology, and community converge. Initially, progress was slow under Rudra Pratap Sharma’s leadership, but the change in CEO invigorated the group.
      </p>
      <p>
        With Swastik Prem Srivastava’s permanent CEO role starting from March 2025, the group has expanded rapidly, adding new apps, stories, and community outreach efforts. The secret plan MM helped reshape the internal system, fostering better creativity and efficiency.
      </p>
      <p>
        Looking ahead, Reco Bladers aims to continue pioneering new digital experiences with a growing team of dedicated members.

    <h2>The Birth of an Idea</h2>
    <p>
      The journey of Reco Bladers began on the crisp autumn day of <strong>26th November 2025</strong>. It was on this day that two visionary minds, Rudra Pratap Sharma and Swastik Prem Srivastava, came together with a shared dream — to create a digital ecosystem like no other. Rudra, the founder, and Swastik, the co-founder, envisioned a community that could blend creativity, technology, and collaboration into a powerful platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      The early days were humble but filled with hope. The founding team worked tirelessly from small rooms and cafes, brainstorming ideas, sketching plans, and coding late into the night. They faced numerous challenges, from technical hurdles to resource constraints, but their determination never wavered.
    </p>
    <p>
      This period was crucial for laying the groundwork of what would eventually grow into the vibrant and diverse Reco Bladers community we know today. Every small victory — a working prototype, a first user sign-up, or positive feedback — fueled their passion.
    </p>

    <h2>Slow Growth Under Rudra's Leadership</h2>
    <p>
      For several months, under the guidance of CEO Rudra Pratap Sharma, the group developed steadily but at a slow pace. The leadership focused on building a democratic structure where every member could voice their opinion. While this encouraged inclusivity, decision-making often became prolonged, delaying major advancements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite the slow tempo, this phase was essential. It allowed the team to create a solid foundation, understanding the needs of their users and experimenting with different technologies and ideas. It was also a time of bonding — team members forged friendships and built trust.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, many within the group felt that greater efficiency and stronger leadership were needed to unlock the true potential of Reco Bladers.

    <h2>New Era: Swastik’s Vision and Leadership</h2>
    <p>
      The dawn of January 2025 marked a turning point. Swastik Prem Srivastava took over the reins as CEO, bringing a fresh perspective and bold vision for the future. Known for his strategic mindset and ability to inspire, Swastik immediately set to work transforming the group’s structure and goals.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of his first major decisions was to shift the group's governance from its existing democratic system to a monarchical model under a secretive plan codenamed "MM." This change aimed to streamline decision-making and accelerate project development.
    </p>
    <p>
      January became a month of remarkable productivity. The team launched their official website, created a custom Gmail service for internal communication, and began outlining plans for an entirely new, custom-built language — an ambitious move that showcased their innovation spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      This period saw the expansion of the group’s membership, with many new talents joining to contribute their skills in coding, design, storytelling, and more.

    <h2>New Governance and the Rise of Monarchial System</h2>

      In a bold move to accelerate decision-making and streamline operations, Swastik Prem Srivastava introduced a monarchial system under the secretive "MM" plan. This governance model centralized decision-making, enabling rapid progress on key projects without the delays of democratic votes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some members initially questioned the shift, but the results spoke for themselves. Project timelines shortened, productivity surged, and new ideas flowed freely. The monarchial system, with Swastik as its leader, brought newfound efficiency to Reco Bladers.
